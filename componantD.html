                            <h4>University of Colorado <br> January 2017 - April 2017</h4>
							
                                 <p>DDuring my junior year at the University of Colorado, I gained design and engineering leadership experience by taking the project manager role in my component design project. I worked with four other engineering students to convert a drift trike into an electric powered vehicle. The form factor of the drift trike caused many technical challenges with the drivetrain. The trike was required to compete in a maneuverability challenge that would consist of many tight turns. Because of this, a one wheel drive system was needed as a differential was not feasible to implement. I developed a concept that the team used to achieve a one-wheel drive system on the trike. By using a cantilevered beam with a self aligning bearing the trike was successfully adapted to have one wheel powered via a chain drive. In addition to my work on the single drive system, I worked side by side with my teammates to develop the powertrain and chain drive used to propel the trike.</p>
